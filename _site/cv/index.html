<h1 class="foot-description">Résumé</h1>

<p>I am a scientist at present working from a private base in Stockholm. My focus is primarily on developing novel methods for mapping and monitoring natural resources using remote sensing in combination with other spatial data. I combine the data by either using machine learning or expert systems with knowledge inferred rules. I believe that the later allows me to develop better hypothesis and also creates more transparent models compared to solely relying on machine learning and remote sensing data. But for some tasks machine learning is superior, as long as you do not get seduced by it.</p>

<p>The map inventories and detected changes and dynamics are interesting in themselves, but using the results for modelling and managing natural resources has become a prerequisite for sustainable use of the Earth´s limited resources. I have hence chosen to devote many years to teaching and disseminating both research methods and research results. As a university lecturer and as a researcher within the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).</p>

<p>I have lived 10 years in Africa, working as a scientist in South Africa (Johannesburg), Uganda (Entebbe) and Kenya (Nairobi). In 1999 I visited Africa for the first time, and fell for the Okavango Delta in Botswana (a huge inlands wetland and one of the most wild and pristine areas in Africa). This led me to quit my career as a lecturer/scientist in Sweden (Uppsala University) and take up a post-doc position at University of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg). The research was great, and the field trips to Okavango even better. I also worked with the tourist industry, training the guides and creating information platforms. I then got a position with ICRAF (World Agroforestry Centre) and moved to Uganda in 2002. I set up a new office in Entebbe, focusing on research and development related to Lake Victoria and the Nile Basin.</p>

<p>I also met my former spouse in Entebbe, and we moved back to Sweden when our daughter was borne in 2005. For 4 years I worked half time as a consulting scientist for ICRAF, and half time as a senior lecturer at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. But Africa pulled us back, in 2009 the family moved to Nairobi, Kenya, and I started working for ICRAF full time again. The first year I worked mainly on development projects relating to climate and land degradation, and then set up and headed the Geoinformatics unit at ICRAF.</p>

<p>In early 2012 we moved back to Sweden, mainly for reasons of education for my family members. I am still mostly working as a consulting scientist for ICRAF and other international research organizations, but also pursuing my own research, including hardware and software development.</p>

<p>Throughout my career my research has centered around applied geoinformatics, thematically ranging from hydrological modeling, mapping and monitoring of soil, water and vegetation, and ecosystem patterns and process.</p>

<p>I have 15 years of teaching experience from Swedish Universities, in natural resource management and geoinformatics. I have developed several dissemination programs for introducing spatial data access and analysis in Africa, Asia and South America.</p>

<p>I have deep knowledge in geoinformatics, remote sensing, spatial data processing, web map building agroforestry, forestry, hydrology, wetlands and systems ecology.</p>

<p>I speak Swedish, English and German fluently, and can manage in French and Spanish (after a week or two). I am also fluent in several programming languages, especially related to spatial data processing. Over the past five years I have mostly turned away from standard packages of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and instead relied on Python (programming language) and the Geographical Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) - the foundation for almost all commercial GIS packages. I can thus set up processes and processing chains that are practically impossible to create with commercial packages.</p>
