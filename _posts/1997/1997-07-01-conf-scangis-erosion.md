Stenström, P. and T. Gumbricht, 1997. GIS for catchment-scale modelling of erosion and reservoir sedimentation. In. H. Hauska (Ed), Proceedings ScanGIS´97 The 6th Scandinavian research conference on Geographical Information Systems 1st to 3rd June 1997 Stockholm, pp 216-228.

<h1 class='foot-description'>Abstract</h1>

An index-approach to catchment-scale soil erosion modelling in six catchments in Cyprus is presented. Within a geographic information system, the four factors commonly accepted to control soil erosion processes are investigated: climate erosivity, soil erodibility, land cover and topography. The factors are combined in a
compound index describing the spatial distribution of erosion susceptibility. Sensitivity to spatial resolution and quantitative errors is analysed, and the potential reservoir sedimentation is estimated via a delivery ratio.
