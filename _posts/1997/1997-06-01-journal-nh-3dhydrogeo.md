abstract: "Geographical Information Systems provide a powerful tool for creating three-dimensional (3D) datasets for sophisticated hydrogeological models. The article describes a GIS with an expert system interface developed for generating 3D hydrogeological frameworks. The system integrates 2D images of elevation and geology and vertical profile data. Application of the expert GIS to a complex aquifer in South Eastern Sweden is described."
