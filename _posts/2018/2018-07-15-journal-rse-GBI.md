abstract: "This article presents a novel Geometric Density Model, GDM, for estimating biomass from optical remote sensing. In GDM, a unitary matrix is defined from spectral endmembers representing the soil line, photosynthetic vegetation and a target feature. In two of the dimensions formed by the orthogonalized space, scale preserving rotations and transformations around a target feature reference line defines the Geometric Density Index, GDI. Noise and non-linear spectral mixing effects are reduced through calibration of the reference line and the rotation axis. Herein we outline the theoretical basis for GDM and then demonstrate its use by estimating crop biomass for several fields in the Central Valley of California with Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper images. Differ- ent machine learning algorithms are used for evaluating GDM noise reduction and systematic bias correction, and to compare GDI performance with other common remote sensing vegetation indices. Models calibrated with log trans- formed regional crop data have root mean square errors of approximately 0.44 to 0.79 ln[gm-2]. The results indicate that GDM is a more robust method for estimating biomass compared to classical vegetation indices but that the noise when aggregating data over space and time degrades model performance. GDM is a deterministic model with several advantages, including: less demand for ground data compared to more elaborate models, transparent and intelligible formulation, and graphical potential facilitating model calibration and interpretation."
