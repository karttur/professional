summary: 'The project on constructed wetlands for waste water treatment originated from the consulting company K-Konsult where I worked 1984 - 1988. I brought this project along when I started my doctoral studies at the Royal Institute of technology (KTH) in 1988. The studies on constructed wetlands formed the basis of my Technical Licentiate degree in 1991. The project results have been published in several journal articles. The overview article on nutrient processes in constructed wetlands is my most cited and widely read publication.'
