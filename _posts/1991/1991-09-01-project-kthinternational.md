summary: "While studying towards my PhD at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) (1988 - 1996) I also worked as a teacher, and was instrumental in creating the first international MSc course (Envirnomental Engineering and Sustainable Infrastructure) offered by KTH. As part of my teaching I organized and led international study tours to Holland, Cyprus and Latvia. The international contacts, and my knowledge in e.g. German, French and Spanish led to several shorter projects in different countries, with some results presented as journal articles, and some at international conferences and proceedings. I also published a journal article on my didactic approach."
