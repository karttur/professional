abstract: "In this review article it is suggested that ocean biota largely determines the climatic regime on earth by controlling the carbon cycle. This implies that ocean biota also can play a significant role in the present scenario of more rapid climate change.

On geological time scales the carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle largely controls the atmospheric carbon dioxide content. As ocean life determines the amount and distribution of carbonate sedimentation, it also controls the long run atmospheric <i>p</i>CO2. Measurements in ice cores have revealed that the ice age oscillation in temperature is strongly correlated to <i>p</i>CO2 and ocean productivity. The most probable sequence of climatic control in the 100 <i>k</i> yr cycle interpreted from those and other data is that ocean productivity induces <i>p</i>CO2 change in turn inducing climate change. There are, however, several other suggestions that rely more heavily on changes in ocean general circulation pattern bringing about the ice age cycles. Estimates of productivity and sinking carbon fluxes in the present ocean are very inconsistent. However, most recent investigation show higher productivity and fluxes than older results indicate. Productivity is probably limited by nitrogen and phosphorus in the warm ocean, and apart from those nutrients also by iron, light and temperature in the cold ocean. All those factors are subject to change in a rapid climate change scenario as well as by other anthropogenic disturbances. This implies that primary production in the ocean will change, and hence also the ocean carbon distribution and net carbon uptake.
