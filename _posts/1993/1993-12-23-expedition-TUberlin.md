summary: "During 1993 I spent all together 6 months in Germany, studying at the Technical University Berlin (TUB) and the University in Kiel (Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel). The studies was made possible by a scholarship from Stockholms Byggmästareförening. It was during this period that I worked out the conceptual basis for my landscape studies, that later also formed the backbone of my PhD thesis."
