<h1 class='foot-description'>Abstract</h1>

Wetlands have a high biodiversity, and are key
regulators of the flow of water and the fluxes of
mineral and nutrients from land to sea. Wetlands
only cover a few percent of the global land surface,
but their soils contain as much carbon as the entire
biosphere. Yet the extent, volume and carbon content
of the world’s wetlands are not accurately known,
in particular, for tropical and sub-tropical regions.
Despite their importance, wetlands have historically
been regarded as wastelands, and have largely been
ignored in studies of climate change. Improved maps
of the distribution of global tropical wetlands, their
volumes and carbon contents are urgently needed.
Because wetlands are characterised by their water,
soil and vegetation conditions, they are difficult to
identify from satellite images of earth. Few of the
existing efforts at mapping the global land surface
have attempted to identify wetlands.

Wetlands exclusively occur under certain topographic
conditions, and where the soil and water conditions
are such that inundation can, and actually does,
occur on a regular (annual) basis. Taking this as
a starting point, a set of novel indexes relating to
wetlands was developed. The first index is a climatic
topographic wetness index. Using a global digital
elevation model, combined with global climate
data, a tropical global map of surface wetness was created. Using global optical satellite images from
the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer
(MODIS) a second wetness index was developed.
Compared to previous satellite-based wetness indexes,
the index attempts to remove the vegetation influence
and focus on the soil surface wetness. From an
annual time-series of MODIS images, the inundation
cycle of the global tropics was captured. The two
wetness indexes are strong candidates for mapping
the distribution of global tropical wetlands.

Traditional image classification is based on reference
data, and usually attempts to delineate features
from a single image. As wetlands are characterised
by annual variations in inundation, an approach
for classifying wetlands from a chrono-sequence
of annual MODIS images was developed. In the
chrono-sequence, only locations with similar
climatic seasonality, and within spatial proximity
were classified based on a reference site. Wetlands,
often with vegetation and wetness phenology out
of phase compared to adjacent dry lands, can thus
be delineated.

Initial results are promising for all approaches
developed in this study; however, lack of reference
sites and reference data has hitherto prevented the
development of a global tropical wetland map.
