summary: "1999 I got a post-doc scholarship from the Royal Academy of Sciences in Sweden, allowing me to move to South Africa and start a post-doc at University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) in Johannesburg. My studies focused on the Okavango swamps in Botswana, but also other regional wetlands. I stayed at Wits for two years, and also worked for a few months with the tourist industry in the Okavango."
