<h1 class='foot-description'>Abstract</h1>

A hydrological model that attempts to incorporate the important
distributed and dynamic effects of vegetation and surface topology is
reported. Regional calibration is done based either on field conditions or
optimization. The model is locally parameterized by GIS and by remotely
sensed derived synoptic parameters of the landscape structure. This is a
simplification of the underlying physical processes with the focus on key
factors modulating system behaviour. Procedures for applying the model
and tests with data from Cyprus and Poland are described. Runoff patterns
in independent periods and drainage basins were successfully modelled.
