astract: "A hydrological model that attempts to incorporate the important distributed and dynamic effects of vegetation and surface topology is reported. Regional calibration is done based either on field conditions or optimization. The model is locally parameterized by GIS and by remotely sensed derived synoptic parameters of the landscape structure. This is a simplification of the underlying physical processes with the focus on key factors modulating system behaviour. Procedures for applying the model and tests with data from Cyprus and Poland are described. Runoff patterns in independent periods and drainage basins were successfully modelled."
