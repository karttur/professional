<h1 class='foot-description'>Abstract</h1>

Knowledge based methods using Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing for land cover classification and future land allocation in Cyprus are presented. Land cover was categorized combining statistical classification and expert rules, using multi-temporal Landsat TM and MSS data, and digitized maps of elevation and geology. Land needed for future infrastructure was allocated using multi-criteria evaluation. Reforestation area were identified for Pinus brutia and P. nigra comparing expert rules and multi-criteria evaluation.
