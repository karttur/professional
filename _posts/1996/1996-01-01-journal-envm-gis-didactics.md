abstract: "The multitude of environmental problems in a world of dynamic and unpredictable natural systems call for new methods that make use of recent development in the digital integration of human reasoning, data and dynamic models. A reported course in Natural Resources Management is based on holistic perception, systems dynamics and cybernetics, and uses geo-informatics as vehicles in projects on eutrophication, acidification, ecological settlings, and Landsat-TM multispectral classification. The projects are efficient, but time consuming, tools for teaching environmental management. Student differences in cognisance are great, and most had problems coupling different models and data, theory and problem solving. Improved multimedia interfaces could be a temporary solution."
