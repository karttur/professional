abstract: 'The Okavango Delta in Botswana is one of the world's most fascinating wetland systems. A hydrological model of the Delta is presented, which is based on a finite difference formulation of the relevant flow processes (surface water and groundwater). Spatially distributed input data include rainfall, evapotranspiration and microtopography. The model results are compared to flooding patterns derived from remote sensing. Some questions concerning the sustainable water use and management of the Delta are discussed in view of the modelling results.'
