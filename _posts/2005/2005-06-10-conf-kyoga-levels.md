  Lake Kyoga is a shallow lake in central Uganda of 3 to 5 m depth forming part of the Equatorial lake system. The lake is around 3000 km2 and the local basin (57,000 km2) drains large parts of Uganda. However, more than 90 % of the inflow originates from the Victoria Nile. The 1997/98 El NinÌƒo flood displaced hundreds of families and dislocated sudds that formed a plug at the outlet which rose the lake level almost 2 meters. Subsequent high flood levels in 2000 destroyed several settlements and led to the drowning of many people. The increase of the lake surface has meant loss of substantial areas of fertile soil, but is also reported by the local communities to have led to higher fish production. In this study, time series of Landsat MSS and (E)TM satellite images has been used to trace recent changes in the area of Lake Kyoga, and compare the flooding data with water levels.
