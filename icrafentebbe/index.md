I was employed by the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) 1 September 2002 and sacked 31 January 2004 (1 February 2004 I was contracted as a consultant with ICRAF).

During 17 months at ICRAF I set up and established a new office in Entebbe, Uganda. I crated several research networks and raised funding for 3 pre-studies and 2 full research project (on [Lake Kyoga](../lakekyoga/) and the Mara River Basin). The three pre-studies included one project funded by GMFZ, and two projects for the Challenge Programme for Water and Food (CPWF). The GMFZ application was, after initial acceptance, handed over to a senior researcher who completely changed the projects (that subsequently did not get funded). CPWF was a programme developed within the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), with the aim of strengthen the research and co-operation. I was the only researcher within  ICRAF (one of 16 CGIAR centres) that managed to get a project accepted by the CPWF - despite being the latest employed. Yet, in the re-organization that followed economic turmoil in 2003 I was sacked. I still get upset thinking about how I was treated, both regarding how I was sacked, how my project proposals were treated, and the negligence along the full chain of "supervisors" influencing my work.

But I had met the mother of my daughter in Entebbe, so I accepted the very economically attractive consultancy, and stayed in Entebbe until march 2005 while working for ICRAF as a consultant. I also, voluntarily and unpaid, administrated the [Lake Kyoga project](../lakekyoga/) that I had created as a co-opeation between Uppsala University and water and fisheries organizations in Uganda. I did not even get paid for my direct costs, or the fact that I had students living at my home in Entebbe, while at the same time the Swedish researchers used project funding for private purchases. My dislike for Uppsala University did not diminish.
