Using Farmer Field Schools Approaches to Overcome Land Degradation in Agro-Pastoral Areas of Kenya. Land degradation assessment â€“ Baseline survey on spatial analysis of land cover / degradation trends and Toolkit Development.

Within the project I created training DVDs at district level (Mberee, Mwingi and Narok districts), including field work and local dissemination. The complete DVD structure and data was produced from avenue scripts (ArcView scripting language) using html, xml and javascript. And the DVDs were used for local training and freely distributed. Neither ArcView (including avenue), nor some of the javascript solutions, are supported any longer.
