I am a scientist focusing on natural resources modeling, mapping, monitoring and management using spatial data processing and analysis. I took my PhD at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in 1996, after having worked in parallel with doctoral studies and teaching, including creating the first international MSc curricula at KTH. I have worked at several Swedish universities and also lived 10 years in Africa, working as a scientist in South Africa (Johannesburg), Uganda (Entebbe) and Kenya (Nairobi). In 1999 I visited Africa for the first time, and fell for the Okavango Delta in Botswana (a huge inlands wetland and one of the most wild and pristine areas in Africa). This led me to quit my career as a lecturer/scientist in Sweden (Uppsala University) and take up a post-doc position at University of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg). The research was great, and the field trips to Okavango even better. I then got a position with ICRAF (World Agroforestry Centre) and moved to Uganda in 2002. There I met my spouse, and we moved back to Sweden when our daughter was borne in 2005. I then worked half time as a senior lecturer at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and half time as a private researcher funded by ICRAF. But Africa pulled us back, in 2009 the family moved to Nairobi, Kenya, and I started working for ICRAF full time again. In early 2012 we moved back to Sweden, mainly for reasons of education for my family members. Since then I am working as a scientist from a private base in Stockholm, mostly for international organisations. My research has always centered on applied geoinformatics, thematically ranging from hydrological modeling, mapping and monitoring of soil, water and vegetation (and other) ecosystem patterns and process, to creating web based map services. I was head of the geoinformatics unit both at Uppsala University (1999-2001), and I created and led the geoinformatics unit at ICRAF in Nairobi.

I have deep knowledge in agroforestry, forestry, hydrology, wetlands, systems ecology, spatial data processing, remote sensing, geoinformatics and web map building.

I speak Swedish, English and German fluently, and can manage in French and Spanish (after a couple of days).

I am also fluent in several programming languages, especially related to spatial data processing.

To see my publications either use the link to Publications at the top of the page, or go directly to my profile pages on Google scholar, Researchgate or Scopus to the left.

Some of the teaching material that I have developed are available via the Teaching link at the top of the page.

In late 2017 I started a set of blogs on how I process spatial data, including how to set up a processing environment for spatial data and how to use machine learning. You reach these blogs via the Blog link at the top of the page.
