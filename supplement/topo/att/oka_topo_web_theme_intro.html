<FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">The Okavango Delta,
Botsvana is one of the world's largest inland deltas. The Okavango
Delta is partly fed by local summer rains. Most of the water,
however, comes from rainfall in the Angolan highlands. It takes
the water several months to reach the</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"

corridor into the Delta. It then takes another two to three months
for the water to transverse the Delta. Hence the flooding is at
its maximum during winter, the driest part of the year. The water
from the Angolan highlands carry approximatey 500 000 tons of
material to the Delta each year. This material accumulates in
the Delta. Mostly on the beds of the channels, and adjacent areas.
The channel beds rise over the surroundings which eventually forces
water into new channels. This continously remolds the Okavango
Delta. The weight of the material causes local earth quakes. The
Delta is also situated on the edge of the African rift valley
which causes regional earth quakes. The earth quakes changes the
general topography of the Delta. Old shorelines and topographic
anomalies indicate that these tectonic processes slightly tilts
the Delta towards the Linayanti. This will eventually seal the
faith of the Delta by diverting water flow to the Zambezi river.</FONT>
