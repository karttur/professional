During my years at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) I arranged a range of international excursion. In 1989 I joined an excisting excursion to the Netherlands. I then reconstructed the excursion to the Netherlands, and arranged it in 1990 and 1991. For the 1992 excursion I created a new excursion, to Cyprus, introducing arid climate resource management. The excursion also used remote sensing and satellite images over Cyprus as a vehicle for preparing the study visit. The excursion to Cyprus was repeated in 1993. In 1994 the course I taught was used for building an international Masters Program (Environmental Engineering and Sustainable Infrastructure), and no excursion was held. Then in 1995, I created an excursion to Latvia, for all the students in the International Masters Program.
