I have over the years created applied geoinformatics training courses in many different countries and with different scopes. Some of the earlier training material is not available at present, including for Nicaragua (water supply of Managua), Panama (water balance of the Panama canal), Colombia (water supply of the city of Manizales), and Ethiopia (Land degradation in Amhara). The training manuals for latter short courses (from 2003 and onwards) are included below.

## Regional GIS Training (RELMA, Nairobi, 2003)

Short training course with thematic focus on Natural Resources Management (NRM). The course centered around 4 exercises introducing Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS).The exercises were built on two free GIS programs; ArcExplorer (created by ESRI as the free viewer version of ArcView) and DIVA-GIS (created by the International Potato Center).

## Okavango Wilderness Safaris (OWS) (Okavango, 2004)

I worked with the tourist industry in the Okavango inland delta, Botswana, during 2004 and 2005. As part of that co-operation I created a series of training lessons introducing geoinformatics for some of the camp guides.

## Rwenzori Mountains Uganda - commemorate centennial climb (FAO, Kampala, 2006)

In June 2006 I took part in the 100 year anniversary of the first climb to the summit of Mount Rwenzori (The Mountains of the Moon) straddling the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Using time series of satellite images and old maps I studied the change in landcover and glaciers, presented as talks and posters, and developed a training exercise.

## Farmer Field School (ICRAF, Nairobi, 2007)

Using Farmer Field Schools Approaches to Overcome Land Degradation in Agro-Pastoral Areas of Kenya. Land degradation assessment â€“ Baseline survey on spatial analysis of land cover / degradation trends and Toolkit Development.

## West African Drylands (UNEP/ICRAF, Segou, 2008)

An Ecosystem Approach to Restoring West African Drylands and Improving Livelihoods through Agroforestry-based Land Management Interventions.

A United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) project conducted in partnership with the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), the Centre for Environmental Policy of the University of Florida, and the Governments of Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal. The project is funded by the Government of Norway.

## Lake Tanganyika Regional Integrated Management Project (UNDP/ICRAF, Lake Tanganyika, 2010/2011)

A United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) / Global Environmental Facility (GEF) project covering the Lake Tanganyika riparian countries, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Zambia.

I organized and led training workshops in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). For the training in the latter three I led the development of a set of training lessons, that were adjusted to cover national data at each training session.
