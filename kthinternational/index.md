During my doctoral studies and as a researcher at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) I supervised a dozen Msc projects, and led international excursions to Holland, Cyprus and Latvia. After the iron curtain fell in 1989 (I happened to be in Berlin when the wall came down, and in Prague during the velvet revolution), I worked with Polish universities for several years. Through students in the international MSc programmes on Environmental Engineering and Sustainable Infrastructure, that I was instrumental for setting up at KTH, I also worked in Latvia and Lithuania.

I took a large interest in didactics, and presented my approaches at different conferences, and also published a journal article.

My knowledge in Spanish led to shorter projects in Nicaragua (protecting the Managua aquifer), Panama (water balance for the Panama canal), Colombia (Hydrological modeling), and Brazil (I could understand Portuguese and was in Brazil during the Rio 2002 meeting). As part of my doctoral studies

I also spent longer periods in Austria (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis - IIASA, studying ocean biota and climate change) Ireland (University college Galway studying hydrology), New Zealand (studying wetlands for waste water treatment) and Germany (TU Berlin, studying landscape ecology).
